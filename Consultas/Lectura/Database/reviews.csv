0, "WowI have no idea how to review this messy film."
0, "The plot sometimes goes into a haltbut thanks to Isabelle Huppert's notable performance and emphasize on her character"""Elle""" is a concise and controlled psychological thriller/drama."

0, "How do you take a story about a victim&nbsp;"
0, "And make it so unempathetic"
0, "Apart from Hupperts performance (which is to be commended even if it is so clinical and removed and unlikeable) Elle is a boringuneven mess of a film."
0, "The beginning of this film made me think it would be a lot more cohesive than it ended up being. It definitely worked in some waysbut I'm not sure if it worked in others. There's a lot going on here with all those charactersand I kind of wish more time had been given to Michèle's relationship with her best friend. I might need to sleep on this. I might actually like this movie."
0, "The beginning of this film also made me think the cat would get more screen time."
0, "There's no doubt that Isabelle Huppert was amazing. There's also no doubt that this film would only be made by a man."
0, "What a horrifically dark and troubling movie.<br> I will say that I do like it. I don't agree with the choices characters make in the moviebut I do like the film."

0, "Se un film non demenziale riesce a non essere mai banale per me raggiunge quasi sempre la sufficienzaElle ci mette difronte una scenografia tra l'eroticoil thriller e il gialloinedito direi. Molte scene che evidenziano un dna francesemolto lontano dagli standardmolto sfacciato e direttoun viaggio nella psiche di chi subisce una violenza sessuale e di chi la circonda. A volte un po' lento ma senz'altro riesce a distinguersi nettamente dalla massae riesce a sedurti perché mostra tutta la perversione che sopratutto il perbenismo nasconde."
0, "Sinceramente non so che dire."
1, "Un battito del cuore sincronizzato quello tra lo spettatore e i personaggiuna connessione ultraterrena. Immagini che scuotono il corpoprovocando eccitazione e sgomento. Una è la parola che unisce tutto: Amore. Le sorelle Wachowski sono molto legate al concetto di amore connesso tra gli individui: <i>Cloud Atlas anticipa quello che poi sarà <i>Sense8,</i> ma a mio parere con una potenza molto più devastante della serie tv Netflix.&nbsp;</p>"
1, "Oltre il tempo e lo spazioAmore rimane per sempre."
1, "I just don't know."
1, "Awesome!"
1, "This was an enjoyable film but felt like a collection of short stories that did not really link up together."
1, "There are some terrible accents..."
1, "I admittedly was distractedbut I remember virtually nothing about this moviewhich says a good bit about this movie. There is just nothing there to keep you pulled in. It's just so convoluted. Maybe it will improve on a re-watchwhich I'm open to. When it endedI wasn't left with a negative impression."
1, "The word """pretentious""" comes to mind."
1, "Bloody hellthis thing went on foreverdidn't it."
1, "Amazing story expressing intellectual view of universe"
1, "Things are only impossible until they're not."
2, "I love the weirdo combination of very brutal graphic violence and heady sci-fi ideasto satisfy both the blockbuster franchise audience and honor the genuine thematic weight of these movies at their best."
2, "God damnsaw it for free and I still wished that I didnt go."
2, "Like watching Paint Dry....beyond belief awful !!!"
2, "i wanna pet alien ugh"
2, "They ruined sexy shower time.<br> NEVER ruin sexy shower time."

2, "I  enjoy main actor in this movie.We  hated everything in this movie.I  hated everything in this movie.My sister enjoy villian in this movie.We  recommend villian in this movie.My sister like main actor in this movie."
3, "Five Stars Featuring:&nbsp;<br> -Brian Cranston yelling"
3, "-That crazy busdriver<br> -Those office workers who were still working while the monsters fought<br> -Awesome sound design<br> -Andy Serkis probably<br> -like seriouslywhy are they still at the office I don't get it"
3, "Ishirō Honda would’ve been proud."
3, "(And just <b>IMAGINE&nbsp;how great <i>Rogue One</i>&nbsp;could’ve been if Kathleen Kennedy didn’t hijack the project.)</p>"
3, "The last American godzilla movie was bad (says toho) but this movie is a love letter to godzilla fans"
3, "Godzilla looked pretty fucking awesome in this and the monster fights were actually really really badass. Some interesting camerawork here and there but otherwise pretty bland.<br> The scene with the dudes jumping out of the plane with the red trails had some cool imagery and musicpretty good stuff.<br> Way too much just people talking. Needs to be a lot more moster fights. I just need a movie with a long ass monster fight that builds and builds and builds and just gets unbelievably insane by the climax. That's what I want."
3, "Got what I wanted."
3, "I too wish Godzilla would blast their atomic breath into my mouthkilling me instantly."
3, "Terrible movie. Despite Ken Watanabe saying """let them fight""" we barely see any Godzilla smack-down in this movie. The first glimpse at possible monster action is cut away and you see just glimpses of the action on some TV screen."
3, "The human leads are wooden and uninteresting and the only actor in the movie that seems like he gives a damnBryan Cranstonis sadly wasted."
3, "i gave up watching this so ehh"
4, "Com uma bagunça de enredo pra se enfiar pancadaria e tiros em vários contextos como a maioria dos filmes de ação fazemporém com trilha sonora impecáveluma série de cenas repletas de neon e o melhor: protagonista femininaele se torna um filme de ação bem melhor que o convencional."
4, "great to look at and very gay but not at all easy to understand"
4, "dont remember who the music director was but they got it right I hav on vinyl or cd EVERY song used in this movie-that's what I listened to in 1989 was so nice goin down memory lane again"
4, "they can all kick my ass thanks.&nbsp;"
4, "also happy birthday to jamesi love and appreciate you so much"
4, "watched this after red sparrow (2018)best cure for a headache ever."
4, "我膚淺...基本上有莎莉賽隆、有露點、有很棒的音樂搭配，就四分起跳。部分劇情的不合理沒邏輯通通可以拋到一旁......."
4, "to be fair I was packing boxes while watching this but i honestly couldn't tell you a thing about this movie if my life depended on it"
4, "Charlize Theron kicking ass for approximately 2 hours to an excellent 80s soundtrack while wearing excellent 80s fashion. Need I say more?"
4, "Fantastic soundtrackbut a John Wick wannabe with confusing plot twists."
4, "John Wick set to a rocking 80's soundtrack. What's not to like?"
4, "We  hated persons in this movie.My dad hated everything in this movie.We  don't like villian in this movie.We  loved villian in this movie.We  like villian in this movie.My sister displeases villian in this movie.I  don't like persons in this movie.My sister displeases villian in this movie."
5, "I only watched the last half of this movie but what I saw was really shitty"
5, "Not sure what I watched. Not sure WHY I watched it since I usually stay away from the horror genre.<br> But... I guess it was okay?"
5, "Počkej si do konce."
5, "The kind of mid-tier thriller you used to see in the mid to late 90'sdone at about that same quality. A lot of funbut definitely a weeknight rental."
5, "weird movie but i feel bad for the guy it's not his fault"
5, "that is why you don't go to a birthday party of someone you barely know"
5, "Three stars solely for McAvoy."
5, "@jamesmcavoy please crush me with your large arms"
5, "Sebagian,<br> berhasil membikin saya terkagum<br> pada akhir"
6, "86/100"
6, "Beauuuuutiful shots of bluuuuuue skies"
6, "Aie...... mon cœur...... il ressent des émotions à nouveau....."
6, "highkey scared for the well being of these child actors."
6, "<br> saw this with @haydenlovesfilm :)"
6, "Justo cuando creí que sería una película insoportable por sus dos antipáticos personajesBaker logra una emotiva película sobre este contraste entre la marginación y el """american dream"""."
6, "El finaluno de los mejores que he visto en el año :')"
6, "To thinkwe could've given the Oscar to Willem Dafoe this year."
6, "I don't know how Sean Baker did it...to create something so tender and compassionate while never denying the grim reality facing the residents of The Magic Castle. The epitome of happiness is mere miles away and to have the characters still so far from it says something about the state of the impoverished in our country."
6, "Absolutely brilliant- totally robbed at the Oscars and a rare example of children who can actually act. Willem Dafoe is also as amazing as always."
6, "Possibly the best movie of 2017. The only contender being Blade Runner 2049which didn't have characters anywhere near as complex or interesting as this."
6, "Just outside of the Happiest Place on Earthdisplaced trailer trash Halley just barely scrapes by living in a hotel and renting her body out to strangers while her daughter roams the streetsblissfully unaware of just how bad her situation is. If you've ever worked in retail or customer service or with the public in any fashionthen Halley's """Whateveryou don't know me!""" attitude will no doubt ring familiar. Worth watching for a heartbreaking performance by the kids and an atypically un-evil Willem Dafoe."
6, "O longa não cai em armadilhas pedantes do cinema independentehá um equilíbrio entre a direção (inventivasem exageros) e a condução da história.<br> Tudo beneficiado pelo ótimo elenco.<br> Inexplicável ausência na lista de melhores longas da última edição do Oscar."
6, "Bomboş filmbomboş. Amerikalıların vatana millete nasıl zararlı olduğunu gösteren bir yapım adeta. Başroldeki ablamız da güzel ama sesi itici. Ayrıca gösteriyor ki çocukları biraz da döverek büyütmek lazım"
7, "not as many neon lights. sad."
7, "Had nooo idea if who played John Wick wasn't Keanu Reeves."
7, "It's not as cool or as surprising as the originaland the main villain is weaker. But it doesn't disappoint eithergiving us some great choreography to chew on. The stand-out performance is from Commonwho has the kind of intenseunbroken stare that makes him a greatconvincing heavy."
7, "Keanu Reeves going rampantbecause why not?!"
7, "It forgets the part that could have really mattered-- John Wick not willing to go back to his old part--but for action-thriller moviesthe fights are quite good."
7, "this movie:<br> - invented neon light&nbsp;<br> - made me attracted to keanu reeves"
7, "Watched it again the king of action movies i love it and waiting like crazies to the third one that would be incredible too Keanu is perfect as john wick he is awesome ."
7, "All about them fights but the star of the show is the world they’ve built.&nbsp;<br> It was hinted and teased in the first film but the secret society of assassins they reveal in this film is so well done.&nbsp;<br> I was worried that after the simple story of the first film this would feel like an unnecessary sequel but the plot unfolds really well.<br> But yeah sick fights wooooooooo!"
7, "Mostly just nice to see both this and <em>Pitch Perfect in 4K UHD. Neither had much in the way of detail that I hadn't seen beforebut the HDR color added plenty to both.</p>"
7, "Also..."
8, "Heckin whacky"
8, "About as magical as movies can get. I forgot just how great this was. I still like Coraline better though. Lowkey """What Have I Done""" might be a Marilyn Manson song at its core"
8, "A film that could easily coast on its richly imaginative gothic visuals'Nightmare Before Christmas' surprisingly manages to also provide a story that's ingeniously simplistic and yet surprisingly insightful. While the stop-motion has dated a littleits still a wonderfully straightforward visual feast for the eyes and the ears and its not hard to see why the movie continues to endure in people's imagination."
8, "greatest cultural appropriation metaphor of all time"
8, "Great and strange movie. Love the characters LockShockand Barreland the Oogie Boogie."
8, "Watched it on acid in a movie theater. 4/5 stars"
8, "Unglaublichwie aufwendig Nightmare Before Christmas gemacht wurde. Allein schon dafür hat er eine gute Wertung verdient.<br> Eigentlich mag ich Tim Burtons Filme ja nicht wirklichaber dieser hier ist derartig aufwendig und kreativ gemachtdass ich viel Spaß beim anschauen hatte. Die Atmosphäre ist wunderbar und ich kann verstehenwieso ihn viele als Klassiker ansehen."
8, "i hate to say it out loudbut i'm kin with that folk that called jack skellington """bone daddy.""""
8, "Utilizing stop motion technologyThe Nightmare Before Christmas is visually stunningfrom the design of the cemetery to Oogie Boogie. The film features great music from Danny Elfman."
8, "4 stars for beautiful animation+1 because my husband used to have a crush on jack skellington-2 because my grown ass loser ass former best friend never shuts up about it."
9, "Disturbingyet thought-provoking with a phenomenal score: quite surprising."
9, "Look. This is a despicable film about despicable people who do despicable things. And it's incredibly hard to watch."
9, "But it's directed by Stanley Kubrickso obviously as a FILMit's incredible."
9, "4 3/4 out of 5 stars - I simply do not think it's quite up there with Kubrick's absolute bestbut who knows...maybe I'm wrong"
9, "80/100"
9, "Unparalleled"
9, "what too heck is going on in here on this very day"
9, "4.75/5"
9, "From the opening orange screen I was completely hooked.... fo some reason."
9, "This is very disturbing and uncomfortable to watchbut I recognize the craft."
9, "Ein Film der die Zeit überlebt."
9, "Every great story starts with a glass of milk."
9, "<br> Ps: the first time I watched it Was with my brotherand I was 12. As for nowI grew up to be a normal healthy non-psychopatic kid 😃"
9, "Singing in the Rain will never be the same"
9, "I can still confidently say that eggy weggs are superior to steaky wakes."
9, "last time i watched this (in middle school) it was the best thing i'd ever seenand blew my mind. this time around the movie just made me sick."
10, "i was high and barely paid attention i need to rewatch this lol"
10, "Probably the funniest Coen Brothers’ comedy I’ve seen so far. Watching these reprehensible morons descend into violence and paranoia is an absolute delight."
10, "Malkovich and Pitt are standoutsbut that's it?"
10, "chaotic &amp; hilarious &amp; stellar cast"
10, "A loving ode to chaos"
10, "I fell asleep halfway through but I liked the parts I saw."
10, "Pretty standard stuff from the Coen brothersthe multiple plot lines would sometimes feel tough to followbut then J.K. Simmons' character would just tell us what had happened."
10, "Streaming. Netflix."
10, "John Malkovich and Brad Pitt were definitely the highlights. Really missed the Deakins-Coen's collaboration here as they work so well together but the cinematography is still really well done nonetheless. Overallit's a super funny film with very memorable moments and characters that has the Coen brothers written all over it."
10, "uh ok i think i liked it"
10, "Chad Pitt deserved so much better"
10, "My friend loved history in this movie.We  contempt persons in this movie.My dad like history in this movie.We  contempt history in this movie.We  like main actor in this movie.My dad enjoy everything in this movie.I  displeases persons in this movie.My dog contempt persons in this movie.We  recommend villian in this movie."

11, "So write me on Instagram."
11, "My name on Instagram:<br> 2.0_._0.3"
11, "( Write me that you're from Letterboxd first that I know you are a LB user )"
11, "The family in this film have all of my heart and that's never gonna change. Every time I finish watching this I happy cry and you bet this viewing carried that streak on."
11, "SO SWEET.<br> Forgot about all that bittersweet tenderness.<br> You goyou brokenill-fitted family ♥"

12, "This was calming and nice."
12, "felt like so much happened but none of it really interested me that much until the last third"
12, "I’m still shock about the end"
12, "It’s really sadI really like the ending of this film and think it’s extremely hard hittingbut the rest of it was thoroughly annoying. I’m left thinkingwas it necessary for the film to have this overly ecstatic 2nd act for the ending to be this good? Should the film be hindered by its necessary sacrifices for the greater final act? Isn’t this just like the most natural compensation between moments of intense and calm?"
12, "How can a fucking Tim Burton movie leave me so quarreled"
13, "Loopers: Assassinos do Futuro"
13, "As excellent as when I saw it over 6 years ago. The storysymbolismand camera work is top notch sci-fi. Rain Johnson has a way of telling stories and this kept me on edge of my seat even on the second viewing! I still also LOVE the ending!"
13, "This review may contain spoilers. <a href="""/trevoroman/film/looper/""" class="""reveal js-reveal""">I can handle the truth.</p>"
13, "This entire movie could be fixed with one throwaway line about parallel timelines"
13, "I love time travel films."
13, "Looper is a film made by a true time-travel fan. Rian Johnson takes a concept that has been presented on film for decades and expands on it in new and exciting ways. The torturous death of a character in this film was the epitome of taking advantage of the concept of time traveland this film takes that entire concept to another level."
13, "I love Looper."
13, "Forgot a lot of the third actso this was quite enjoyable for my third watch. I love a lot that this movie doesespecially a groundedno-nonsense view of time travel and the future. I hope Rian comes back to original work at some point."
13, "i love u Rian Johnson"
13, "Clever premisecool styleand I really dig JGL playing young Willis. I wasn’t bothered by any paradox bullshit but I’m also stupid and don’t pick up on those things so I dunno. Also I didn’t know Emily Blunt was in this? Even though I’ve seen it before?!?"
13, "If anythingthis film just demonstrates Johnson’s willingness to make bold moveswhich I think everyone saw paid off in his future endeavors."
13, "I think I've seen too much time travel stuff.<br> This was really good though."
13, "A movie about finding yourself :’)"
13, "Always a pleasure to watch. The visualsthe scriptthe leadsall great."
14, "What really sells this movie is how effortless it feels. You slip into these storiesand forget you are watching a film."
14, "One of Tom Hanks best performances."

14, "8.5/10"
14, "How did Vin Diesel go from this to fast and furious?"
14, "One of Spielberg’s best and has maybe the greatest and second greatest battle sequences In film history. Can quote every line and love how Spielberg uses the camera. A lot to like here."
14, "One of the best war movies I have ever seenfull on gore that shows the real horror of war. Intensifying all the way through and is why I always rewatch it."

15, "فيلم رائع جدا وبلمس القلب &lt;3"
15, "I don’t know why we watched this in my Spanish class but I’m not complaining! Beautiful friendship between Philippe and Drisswith a story that realistically examines disability without pitying or over-dramatizing it’s characters."
15, "2 oder 3 mal in der Schule gesehen. Nicht schlecht."
15, "المخرج بخل علينا والله انه خلى الفيلم ساعتين بس"
15, "Beautiful"

15, "As far as feel-good crowd pleasing movies gothis one is really good. Definitely a movie I could show to my family."
15, "<br> Howeverthe sexual harassment subplot has NOT aged well. It’s a shame to have such an uncomfortable and poorly handled set of gags in an otherwise largely unproblematic film."
15, "Es demasiado bonita."
15, "Omar Sy was greatbut a bit of a sexual harasser."
15, "Best use of Earthwind and fire I've ever seen in a French film."

16, "Decent cult comedyI enjoyed the light takes on many of the common vampire tropeswithout falling fully into parody."
16, "Not the funniest movie I've ever seenbut definitely not too bad either."
16, "This movie is a giant heart and clever wrapped in the perfect big dumb package."
16, "Whenever I finish this movie I usually think to myselfwhat if I just watched it again right now. Do I really have anything I need to do today?&nbsp;"

17, "8/10"
17, "Anton"
17, "I remember being so hypped for this movie around its release datebut for 5 years I never watched it and I really dont know why... now I feel this could have save my teen years"
17, "🌹"
17, "Largely plotless but has an atmosphere so thick and beautiful and mesmerising that it's hard to care."

17, "I just can't get enough of the way Mr. Jarmusch looks at the world...<br> I'd very much like to believe his version of it all."
17, "Gente misericórdiaeu levei quatroQUATRO fucking days pra terminar esse filmepor pura insistência pq não gosto de ver filme pela metade.<br> Tilda Swinton está maravilhosa nesse filme mas nem isso conseguiu me segurar para ver ele sem interromper. Enfim eu sei que a proposta do filme é ser mais monótono mesmo mas ainda assim tem filmes nesse mesmo estilo bem melhores que esse"
17, "Immortal lovers interested in musicarts and science played by Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston. They also love Jack White. What else could you ask for? Brilliant acting and great metaphors about the dying culture of our world."
18, "64/100"
18, "Great!"
18, "Batman is one of the best Batman films. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as the Joker/Jack Napier and Michael Keaton is terrific as the Dark Knight. The set designs are amazingas is the score by Danny Elfman. One of the best comic book films."
18, "Visually outdated sometimes (in terms of propseffects and stunts) but generally stands the test of time."
18, "Jack Nicholson (and everyone elsereally) is too much of a character for me but I guess it works well with the whole movie being a little more exaggerated than reality (and considering the fact that it's a Tim Burton film)."
18, "A good movie overallespecially for one that is almost thirty years old."
18, "Watched for Music in Film class."
18, """"He don't look happyhe's been using Brand X.""""
18, "Still so much fun and I absolutely love the way Gotham looks in thisit fits so well with the Burton aesthetic. Nicholson still terrific."
18, "Keaton is the best Batman"
18, "This was one of my favourites when I was a little kidand I can still respect it on a technical levelespecially for its time. But...there are problems. Numerous problemsmade all the more glaring by Nolan's 'Begins' -- a demonstration on how this should be done. Shot during a writer strikeBurton had free reign to make creative changes to the mythoswhich results in some mind-bogglingly stupid bitsand a film that's more Jack being Jack than actual Batman. Alsothe Prince songs suck."
18, "Since this is one of Burton’s more restrained moviesit actually makes total sense that the most Burton thing about this is the overbuilt noir-style Gotham. With all the buildings seemingly growing out of each other and the floods of gray and blackit makes sense that this city would be responsible for a guy who dresses up like a giant bat fighting an insane crime boss with an affinity for clowns"
18, "I’ll take Burton’s take over Nolan’sbut even for a superhero movie this has a hard on for the damsel in distress."
18, "Direction: 1<br> Writing/Story: 0<br> Performances: 1 (for Nicholson)<br> Enjoyability: 2<br> Notability: 0"
18, "uhhh theres some good industrial gothic"
18, "We  like history in this movie.I  contempt main actor in this movie."
19, "<i>Snakes whistling through the water<br> <i>Mud in the trees</i><br> <i>She sang me a southern lullaby&nbsp;</i><br> <i>As we drifted in the delta breeze</i><br> <i><br></i></p>"
19, "Mud is actually a love story surrounding the shattering and reconstruction of a growing boy’s idea of what love is. The film shows his gradual shift from naivety to the subject to a mature understanding of its complexity. A good one!"
19, "Not the first story that sees a couple of boys helping out a man on the run...Mark Twain wrote a good oneas does Jeff Nichols the writer director of this film.

20, "If this movie had any sort of compelling villainit would be in the top 10 superhero movies of all time just based on its style. Unfortunatelythis movie just lacked any excitement in the plot driving this film along. Overallnot a bad watch but sorely disappointing because you understand how close this film was to being great."
20, "The wolverine was pretty good."
20, "Unquestionably a massive step-up on Originsand from a character stand-point it makes an interesting case for the events of X3 to not be tossed out of continuity. For a big summer blockbuster this is surprisingly pared-down and focused on characterwhich is a welcome relief. It is entirely predictable howeverthough Mangold ensures it's still very well-made and visually interesting. The post-credits sting is almost better than the movie. I was so hungry for nabeyaki udon after watching this."

25, "It is a film that feels too long and doesn't fully live up to its name. I would've found it more interesting had the director decided to tell the story of Juba rather than Maximus.

36, "There's a special kind of craftsmanship that goes into knowing how long to linger on a wide shot before the viewer understands why they've been hearing the same car horn for 16 seconds. YesI counted."

36, "Cineopolis Westlake"
37, "Soft-lensed dream. A psychologically restrictive nightmare. A coming-of-age tragedy filled with raging metrocolor horror."
37, "I don’t think I’ve watched this movie in over twenty yearsand holy shit does it hold up - especially in a packed theater. Great performancesgreat editingand I really loved the music - specifically in the prom scene as Sue is starting to notice the rope going to the bucket. And I love that long take as Carrie goes up to the stage and the camera goes through the crowd and to the bucketetc. Such a great shot. Great moviebut it does drag just a tad at the end."

37, "Charming. What happened to William Katt?"
37, "chocolate com pimenta (2003)"
37, "This was incredibly disappointing. Depalma’s predatorial male gaze was repugnant from the off-set and none of the characters were fleshed out nor did I really feel the depth of the complex relationship between Carrie and her mother. Just go read the book instead."
37, "The scariest thing this movie has is that horrifying and ugly Jesus statue."
37, "Peak De Palma! A classic. See it in a theater. It’s a different experience."
37, "Still to this day its one of my favorite movies. the way its shot and the way the story is told still grasps the viewer to this day. Making them feel like theyre living through carrie's torment with her. The story is an extremely accurate and relatable tale of how many teens can feel trapped by their peersparentsreligion and teachers. Stephen King is an amazing writer and the screenplay perfectly visualises his writing."
38, "INTO THE WILD erzählt die wahre Geschichte von Christopher McCandless. An Originalschauplätzen gedrehtfängt Sean Penn atemberaubende Bilder eindie mit dem genialen Soundtrack von Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) zu einer meisterhaften Symbiose verschmelzen. Emile Hirsch liefert als Chris zudem eine schlicht geniale Darbietung ab. Er portraitiert einen Mann mit dem unbändigen Wunsch nach Freiheit. Doch letztlich kämpfte er nicht gegen die Natursondern gegen sich selbst. Ein Meisterwerk."
38, "hated the first 20m then i liked it"

38, "I previously rated this film one star becauseas someone who lives in Alaskathis story infuriates me. Howeveron my second viewingI decided to look past the character's absence of knowledge and focus on the film itself. Strictly the telling of this story is brilliant. Sean Penn and his team did a wonderful job portraying Chris as a passionate wanderer while also showcasing his mistakes. Hopefully others don't make the same ones."

I'm not sure why.<br> StillI'm not sure what else I could hope for in a spy action movie. Following someone who doesn't know who they are can be clichebut Liman and Damon pull it off.<br> Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are so fun."

39, "BEST..."
39, "Whatever happened to Franka Potente? That's what I kept thinking as I rewatched this kineticyouthful spy movie. As Jason Bourne tries to evade a sinister American government agency while figuring out who he iswe're treated to a sometimes funnyalways thrilling ride through Europe.

Even more so how Harry still wants him around after all of this. Pacing of scenes was also off a lot of times and there were just too many inconsistencies that interfere with the rest of the films's canon.

Either wayfor me the most significant aspect of the film is the beginning and the end. They're the same scenebut audience members now consume the shot differently because they're perception has been changed compared to the start. Rather then seeing a regular folk singer getting beaten for whatever reason it may bewe instead feel this overwhelming wave of empathy for Isaac's character and a poignant connection we didn't have beforehand."

55, "Die Message von DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES ist so simpel wie zeitlos: der Frieden ist dem Krieg jederzeit vorzuziehen. Matt CLOVERFIELD Reeves und sein Effekte-Team (Weta Digitalwelche u.a. bereits bei der THE LORD OF THE RINGS-Trilogie für die Effekte verantwortlich waren) erschufen grossartige Momentewelche die eher einfach gestrickte Story meist in den Hintergrund drängt. Die interessantesten Figuren sind hier die CGI-Affen und nicht etwa die Menschen; bestes Beispiel hierfür ist der unterforderte Gary Oldman. Etwas vorhersehbar und nicht ohne Klischeesjedoch ein grossartig getrickster und in der zweiten Hälfte mitreissender Sommer-Blockbuster."
55, "That horse-ridingmachine gun-wielding ape villain really stole the show!"

The writing and consistency in this movie along with some of the best action sequences we got in 2014. A flawless movie in the Sci-Fi/Action genre."
55, "Very good considering it's essentially setting the stage for the next installment. I wish that the human characters had been more than mere sketchesbut this movie truly belongs to the apes. Caesar's story is fascinating to follow and I'm anxious to see what happens next."
55, "The first movie of the prequel was very goodin fact at the time I really appreciatedand the reviews I read told everything the same thing: that this one was better. Mahmaybe for some technical things or acting performancesbut although the intentions were good and the directors didn't want just a usual blockbuster and the trama was not negative at allthe problem was that the plot was partially uninteresting and too long to developespecially the initial part in which the two races get in touch for the first time after years of isolation."
55, "esperaba mucho más :("
55, "Manmaybe a tad better than the first film. It's really close though. I like the setting betterand Gary Oldman is great as alwaysand the effects are taken to another level from the first. I love seeing the society the apes have built. The last battle isn't quite greatbut Koba makes for a compelling villain and the scene of him riding through the fire on horseback is too dope."

56, "An okay but not great adaptation of Alan Moore's wondrous and semi-complicated graphic novel about resistance against tyranny in an England of the near-future."
56, "Hugo Weaving is superb here and this film is certainly stylish. Natalie Portman is also very good. However I found the British tyrannical regime unconvincing and was slightly bored during the scenes with the police and politicians.&nbsp;The English/British inaccuracies in the dialogue were also annoying from a Scottish perspective."

57, "a series of skillfully restrained vignettes that knowingly distances the sensational legacy of an american dynasty enough to explore its icon’s own narratives"
57, "the cinematography is exceptional and unlike something like silence of the lambs it justifies the close framing of the characters faces much better since intimacy is a consistent theme of the film rather than an arbitrary stylistic choice"
57, "Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career and should really have been rewarded with an Oscar."
57, "While the film takes place over a few short weeks following the death of her husbandPortman portrays Jackie as an incredibly complex and strong individual. While she falls apart in private she continues to portray the ‘correct’ image for the American public."
57, "She takes on the burden of grief not just for her family but an entire nationwhile protecting the legacy of her husband."
57, "i made the mistake of watching this on tv and for some reason i can’t be completely into a movie that i watch on tv? anyways i’ll rewatch this because the cinematography and camera moves were really great"
57, "Feels like it's deeeep while watching but here I am a day after and am not so sure it was. Either way Natalie Portman kills it"
57, "Everything seems rightbut everything is wrong! The script and Portman's performance are intolerableand the musicwhich is beautifully writtenyet distorts the picture and pushes the audiences further and further..."
57, "Natalie Portman is so magnetic and her Jackie is so compelling that you <i>almost ignore the impeccable camerawork and fantastic score. The way Larrain weaves legacytruthgrief and Jackie’s trauma together is pureunrivaled filmmaking.</p>"

58, "An exciting continuation of the story that expands on the ideas and themes presented in the first filmbut ultimately felt incomplete. This is a film that is inherently built to be part of a larger wholeso it is somewhat understandablebut it makes no effort to tell a well rounded story arcand ends at the 2.5 hour mark without any semblance of conclusion. It is hard to review a movies like this individually when they are only ever meant to be one piece of a puzzle. It doesn't really hold up as its own thing."
58, "The arena in this is so much better than the last one. The movie itself also improves upon its predecessor as the games are even more exciting."
58, "An improvement on the first onebut againafter reading the bookthe book wins out."
58, "A bit repetitive after the first episodeand also considering that it's 2h20' longthere are some plot jumps that are maybe avoidable. Anywayfor being a middle movieis good enough to be remebered with small pleasure. I just hate that the third chapter will be divided in two partsas it's usual after the last of Harry Potter movies."
58, "It was better than the first one which was actually a Battle Royale copyand now I like this second one with the idea of that revolution. I hope the Mockingjay will be even better..."
58, "<i>Catching Fire is pretty much the same film as the first <i>Hunger Games</i>. Only with a more creative art directiona little political intrigue and a camera that isn’t powered by a vibrator.

60, "I wouldn't recommend going into this movie expecting a completely faithful and straightforward adaptation of the book. Every bit of nuance and complexity offered by Fitzgerald's novel is pretty much lost in Baz Luhrmann's extravagant style of directionwrapping the typical 20's love triangle story in a wacky and loud package filled with a sweeping cameraelaborate set designand a soundtrack by <i>fucking Jay-Z.</p>"
60, "This is more of a pseudo-comedic blockbuster than it is <i>Gatsby. It's definitely nothing special or significant or prophetic or socially aware or anything more than what it is—but heyit's fun.</p>"
60, "Absolutely stunning to look atbut like most of Luhrmann's filmsit too often favors style over substance. Much of the modern music used throughout didn't work and took me completely out of the movie."
60, "I get itit's how he directsbut some of the camera swinging in this movie makes me physically ill.<br> The colors and costumes are beautiful and the acting is greatbut something about it just doesn't hit the mark with methings just felt so overplayed and I couldn't get with it. The ending is more true to the story than the beginningwhich I can appreciatebut idk it's just not the book."
60, "ps. Young teenage James Gatz can get it."
60, "The movie has a look that effectively recreates the world described in the source materialbut it’s very cold and distantand never let me be fully immersed in its story as I was with the novel.

71, "Paterson is a cinematic tribute to the poetry of everyday life. The film portrays the daily routine of a sympatheticdown-to-earth bus driver with a typical Jarmusch rhythm. That rhythm is recurring in all kinds of waysfrom the painted and baked patterns of his artistic girlfriend to the meditative repetition of the daily bus rides. The charismatic Adam Driver (what's in a name) steals your heart as the disarmingmild-mannered bus driverand the soothing music and of course the written poetry complete the tranquilbeautiful atmosphere."

71, "My first Jim Jarmusch movieand I already feel irrevocably changed. A simple story of people trying to express their creativityfree of conflict or cynicism<i>Paterson is an experience that I found life-affirming on a deeply personal level. Jarmusch's direction is impeccablethe characters and their environment are richly realisedand Adam Driver delivers what could be his best performance. On the wholeit's a transcendent exercise in visual poetry that also serves as a compelling tribute to the power of written verse.</p>"

73, "Really couldn't get into this on a rewatch. The film feels cold and bland and without and distinguishable personality. The scenes set in New Mexico are amongst the dullest in the entire Marvel franchiseand unfortunately that's where the vast majority of the movie decided to remain. Tom Hiddleston is fantastic as Lokiwho for the longest time was Marvel's unchallenged greatest villain in the films.

It's all in the timing. The placement of beats of humour within tension is something that a lot of action/adventure films today can't seem to nail.

85, "Dolores Umbridge is still one of the most detestable villains of all time. Perfect casting/acting as well. Less likable than Voldemort."

86, "This is one of my ALL TIME favorite films. No matter how many times I watch it it’s just as intense and captivating every single time. When this first came out in theater I saw it 3 times before it even came out on DVD. Tonight I indtroduced this video to a new friendso it was super fun. This is a must see!"
86, """"I like Shrek.""""
86, "<br> It's unfortunate that this film will always be viewed as a missed opportunity because it is clear that there is significant potential for it to be a great film. And to be fair to 'I Am Legend'the first 70% of the film was both captivating and atmosphericnot to mention perfectly acted by Will Smith. However once another character was added to the narrative it began to lose its momentum and I lost interest. With such potentialI think a remake is in order."
86, "Sit down. Try not to cry. Cry a lot."
86, "one of the best movies of this genreif you agreebreath."

86, "Decent science fiction dramawith a great performance from Will Smith. I think the CGI was a bit cheap and bad at timesbut it didn't detract from the overall enjoyment factor. Ultimately though I liked it."

87, "For Paul."
87, "The car karate movie made me cry."
87, "Entertaining"
87, "More serious in tone than I expectedthe dialogue and acting are laughable at timesand it suffers from a sparing usage of The Rock. But the action and fight sequences are funridiculous and excitingand there is a nice send-off for Walker at the end."
87, "🤫<br> Guilty pleasure"
88, "A lot of people say that the second one is the best in the new Planet of the Apes seriesbut I really like this one the best (even though all three are incredible). It blends a personal story of fatherhood with a grander story of evolution."

88, "A substance designed to help the brain repair itself gives rise to a super-intelligent chimpanzee who leads an ape uprising."
88, "First rewatchand I had a really good time. I appreciate the build-up and giving the audience a fully realized look into the connection between Caesar and Rodman. Under 2 hours which is a rarity these days. I look forward to revisiting the other 2 installments in this series."

88, "Great prequel! But why am I rooting for apes? Charlton Heston must be rolling in his grave. """Damndirty ape!""""
88, "The film is undoubtedly carried by the emotional power of Andy Serkis's performance as Caesara mo-cap masterclass that is as much an acting accomplishment as it is a technological one. Lithgow too turns in an extremely affecting performanceand the two of themalong with director Rupert Wyattdo their best to make James Franco emotionally relatable. (I kid. He ain't bad here.) It's tough to tell what's more surprising: that this movie is so goodor that Wyatt's done nothing of note since."
88, "It’s a film that thrives on the “showdon’t tell” philosophyusing visual storytelling as a means of both exposition and character development in order to move us through a rather sprawling plot (in terms of passage of time) at an expeditious but not overwhelming pace."

88, "Ich muss gestehendass ich noch nie Planet der Affen gesehen habe und daher ganz besonders gespannt auf diesen Film war."
88, """"Rise of the Planet of the Apes""" ist ein toller Filmder (wie wahrscheinlich jeder Planet der Affen-Film) eine ziemlich tiefgründige Story hat.<br> Dennoch ist der Film keine schwere Kostdenn dafür gibt es genug Kampfszenen und ActionSequencen. Die haben es aber richtig in sich.<br> Klar ist das CGI hier und da nicht mehr auf dem neusten Standaber ich denke darüber kann man hinweg sehen."
88, "I  hated persons in this movie."
89, "Probably wouldn't watch this one again since it's super spooky but it was a good film overall. Didn't really enjoy the jumpscaresbut I suppose that comes with every horror movie and I should have seen it coming."
89, "wellI asked to watch a scary movie so I got what I deserved. farewellsleep. the punishment fits the crime"
89, "Idk I just think paranormal movies are so cheesy. Patrick Wilson's hotthough"
89, "James Wan again proves why he is one of the best horror directors working today. The Conjuring got a R-rating just because it’s so scaryand I can see why. Supposedly based on a true storywhich contributes to the scariness of the film. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga work well together as the Warrens. One of the best modern horror movies today."
89, "Absolutely all of this could have been avoided if they'd only listened to the dog."
89, "I fell asleep."
89, "James Wan shows off his chops in this already iconic horror flick. From the first five minutesyou can tell the film's director expertly crafted a story that pays its respects to the horror of the pastwhile at the same time being new and (somehow) real."
89, "It does what the MCU does in that it tells an important story with all the needed gravitas and still establishes a bigger picture that entices audiences for more. No wonder we got a sequeltwo spinoffsand a spinoff prequel from this. James Wan is the new face of horror."
89, "You know when you’re scaredyou start to shake and your eyes start to waterand when something scary happens you just sit there and try not to cry?&nbsp;"

92, "The special effects doesn't hold up well todayand it was not as fun seeing Arnie channel the bad cyborg as much as it was great seeing his comical side in T2.

92, "Perfect example of inevitable destruction."
92, "I am just a huge fan of 80ies Science Fiction movie. I love the special effectsand how you can easily seethat the destroyed world was filmed in a studio and looks more than a stage than a real world. Its one of the 80ies classics and always a good choice for a movie night. I like the second part a little bit moreeven they are very similar. Also James Cameron did some great shots."

It has some great moments and the dynamic between Eastwood the Thao is very intresting to watch. The ending is sweet and Eastwoods character is so much fun to watch.

Luckilyhe doesn't appear on screen here and instead we get a cast of entertaininglikable actors headed by the always-enjoyable Owen Wilson. The streets of Paris look so magical and delightful here; as the main character saysthe whole city is like it's own art form. It's exciting to explore 20s France with the main characterand discover all the famous writers and artists hidden in its streets. Corey Stoll is especially good as Ernest Hemingway."

Scorsese did an excellent job conveying the loneliness and isolation that DiCaprio’s character experiences. Matt Damon was very convincing as a smug crooked cop and Mark Wahlberg as always as a bad ass. The scene where DiCaprio and Damon first speak is the best in the film for me."

I like that it's so subtle and not like any other coming-of-age film that i've seenit was like a breathe of fresh air but in a bizarre way. May i also add how captivating and stunning Ms. Katharine Ross is? i fell inlove with her the moment i saw the portrait.</p>"
125, "Fantastic film with really ambitious shot conpostions and editing choices. I love how inviting the images and how rich they look on screen.

125, "A brilliant satire on loneliness and disillusionment. It's about that weird moment when you first become an adult and are unsure of what to do with yourself. Throughout <i>The Graduatethis early-life crisis morphs into a fantasy but it's a hilarious and awkward journey that's enjoyable from beginning to end. I love the style and camerawork in <i>The Graduate</i>with the intimate cinematography (filled with iconic moments) and fantastic music making this a totally pleasurable experience.

The scene with """Everyday""" especially got me."
130, "This is my all time favorite movie. I knew it as soon as I walked out of the theatre when the credits finally rolled. This movie gave me more cinematic entertainment and joy than I've ever experienced before or since. Superman has always been my favorite fictional character even before this film was released and that undoubtedly contributed to my enjoyment of the film. This whole filmtied together by Zimmer's masterpiece of a film scoreinspires and entertains."

The score for this movie is powerfulemotional and the theme song sends chills down my body every time I hear it. It's incredible. Butthe actual movie itself is an overblownboring as fuck mess seeped in an ugly grey colour palette that delivers no sense of emotion whatsoever."

Allen is smugand the tone of Annie's character aquaplanes from one scene to the next. It's cleverit's funnybut it misses something critical.

Maybe it was because I was super stoned and not even in the mood to watch itor maybe it was because it was a try hard action film that didn't keep me entertained what so ever.

142, "Phillip Seymour Hoffman is easily my favorite performance in the film and I wish his character had more screen time<br> Music and film should be honest and unmercifuljust like what William learns about journalism<br> William’s performance kept pulling me out of the moviehe came across as too forceful at timesbut a lot of the supporting cast was great"

144, "Sequel to the modern spy satire. I remember enjoying the first film and this movie keeps trying to remind you of that. It does a lot of the same things as the first oneyet this lacks that freshness the first one had. Still a decent action filmsome of the tropes and characters choices that I enjoyed in the first installment started to grate here. I do think Taron Egerton has grown a lot and is a much better leading man this time around."
144, "I would watch 19 more hours of Taron Egerton hanging out with his princess girlfriendadorable dogand friends from the old hood in all their accent glory. Also let’s put Mark Strong in everything from now on."
144, "pedro pascal cracking a whip does things.. needless to say i’m horny"
144, "A Very good sequel. I'm sad a couple of the characters died but it worked within the story. The fight scenes were smoother. The Gillan was still interesting but not as good as valentine. Overall good and curious to see were it goes next."
144, "I never saw the first Kingsmanbut I get the picture. This movie is overlongtonally inconsistentstruggles with suspension of disbeliefand seems to tacitly endorse some of the violent fantasy escapism it revels in. But Julianne Moore is alright as a rockabilly villainI suppose."

147, "Eddie Redmayne is damn good in thisbut Michael Keaton should have won Best Actorjust being honest."
147, "A beautiful depiction of a life. I felt kind of underwhelmed at timesbut I could see the world in the way that he did and understand what motivated him. I think one of the best parts of this narrative was that it wasn't riddled with despair-- it had its momentsbut I could see the beauty everywhere and understand the impact of a life."

148, "American Beauty offers a thought-provoking film about changing and wanting to be better.

148, "Wellsafe to say this did not age well to Kevin Spacey. However this movie is incredible. A whole shit ton of substance. Beautiful cinematography. Great performances across the board.

It was funnyand the touching moments are very well done. Disney tried to replicate this format with Moana and Frozenbut I believe they missed the mark completely."
151, "Unlike a lot of Disney movies this one has actually gotten better with multiple viewings. The characters aren’t as grating after the tenth view and most of comic relief isn’t so in-your-face obnoxious."

It's got the type of dialogue you expect from McDonagh and plenty of over-the-top violence. I didn't care for the characters at all or the story that they're apart of. Overallthis was entertaining at the very least but not enough to make it memorable."
152, "The third act is easily the best part of this whole film. It is funny and very exciting to watch. The cast gives some very good performences especially Sam Rockwell. There are also some gorgeous shots and this film is very funny. But there were some parts were it lost a little steam for me but other than that I had a pretty enjoyable watch."

153, "I honestly had forgotten how dark this movie actually was. I haven’t revisited it in yearsopting to usually watch one of the goofy sequelsso it was easy to forget that Freddy wasn’t always the wise crackingfun loving goofball I pictured him as. I wonder if this would change my opinion on the reboot? NahI’m sure it’s still shit."

153, "This hasn’t dated welland the more I watch itthe worse it seems to get. Some of the ideas in it are greatit was just a shame that the budget wasn’t available to make this the visual spectacle it could’ve been. Not that it would’ve improved the acting - her mother seems to be the female equivalent of Nicholas Cage at his worst."

156, "Aranofsky’s allegory for.. something? Several things? What I mostly appreciated about “Mother!” was following all of the discussionswhere everyone seems to have a different interpretation of its meaning. Actually watching ithoweverwas more of a chore. While the performances were decent and the filmmaking was actually solidAranofsky is very heavy-handed in every layers he adds. Somehow that worked for me in “The Shape of Water”but it just bothered me here. So while I am glad I watched itI might not feel that way while watching it."

A solid watch for a cloudy Saturday afternoon."

158, "It was a good moviebut I don’t like scary cults. So it wasn’t for me."

176, "After the tremendous failures of X3 AND Origins: Wolverinethis was the return to form a lot of us X-Men fans were hoping for."

178, "A totally bombastic movie with a gorgeous sense of artiface to it. Burton really tapped into classic WB for this one."
178, "My favorite superhero/comic-based film adaptation and Tim Burton film- maybe because it's such a big Hollywood blockbuster handed completely over to Burton. That has some drawbacksbut I've grown to appreciate all those eccentric details inherent to Burton's dark hand. Michelle Pfhifer IS the poster-woman for the current #MeToo movement. (To the woman she's just saved) """You make it so easy don't you? Always waiting on some BatMAN to save you??""" Meow!"
178, "Batman Returns would be the very last of the good Batman films from the 90’s. Although this movie isn’t as good as the firstit is still equally as fun. The film still holds the same classic gothic look and the signature comic book feel that the first movie had so it is enjoyably familiar.

185, "I think I was expecting way too much"
185, "Still not sure how I feel about this. It's a polarizing and discomforting watchdraining and exhaustive at pointsespecially the wedding sequence. But it succeeded in completely immersing me in both sisters' inner crises. A wedding has never felt more agonizing and longand a fictional planet hurling towards earth has never felt more terrifyingly real and imminent. &nbsp;I've been meaning to check out Lars von trier's work for a whileand I'm intrigued to say the least. I'm looking forward to checking out more"

185, "Lars von Trier has a talent of confusing me evey time I watch something from him."
185, "Seven days have passed and i am still not sure how to approach this film. I'm not even sure is the mark it has now is what i think about it. I won't hesitate to call this piece pretentious( a word i avoid using as much as possible) and dreadfully boring but at the same time i was drawn to itpossible by the great acting( but due to Von Trier being unable to write real people not that splendid) and some intriguing themes. And just to clarifythe second part is just one big metaphor."
185, "Lars von trier is awesome director"
185, "I  enjoy history in this movie.We  enjoy main actor in this movie.My dog recommend everything in this movie.We  like persons in this movie."
186, "The good thing about this film is that it doesn't muck about. You're there for the zombiesand after the obligatory action movie opening scene where the hero shares loving banter with his kids over breakfast while his wife makes pancakesBAM the zombies arrive. Then Brad Pitt carries around his annoying kids while fighting the zombies for a bitbut after he drops them off and gets on with things himself things improve. These zombies are very quick and throw themseves head-first into windowsso if you're one of those people who prefers the classic slow mindless zombies then this film is not for you."

186, "Personalmente mi è piaciuto parecchiointeressante il modo in cui è stato risolto il problemaben fatto in generale almeno in parte diverso dai soliti. Da vedere."
186, "When you put two things I like together:&nbsp;"
186, "Brad Pitt + zombies = badass handsome smoothie&nbsp;"
186, "Not going to lie when it first came out I was so skeptic of it cause it wasn’t going by the book and <i>The Walking Dead&nbsp;kind of sludge-d me from zombies for awhile with its whole soap opera drama.</p>"
186, "But seeing it then I was so impressed with it and to this day if the apocalypse happens I will duct tape some porno mags to my arms and legs cause I want to be protected with style."
186, "Not the best film by Brad Pittalone in a poor cast. Like all literary transpositionsthe film isn't a very good but the idea is interesting (I think the book is better than the filmeven if I haven't read it).<br> Something is missing to be a thriller/horror film. The sceneswhich really made me jump on the sofa from scareare only twotoo fewbut the suspense is not lacking."
186, "Really subverts the tropes of a typical zombie moviethough it’s a complete departure from the books. Also: it’s the greatest Pepsi commercial of all time."
186, "It didn’t feel like a zombie movie to me."
186, "Nothing like the book. &nbsp;The book is AMAZING. &nbsp;They should’ve just called this something elseit’s a fine zombie movie. &nbsp;The fact that they just use the name of book is so wronghonestly it should be a crime. &nbsp;Sellouts."
186, "Better than expected; the action sequences are very exciting and well done. Howeverby moving away from the book's focus on multiple charactersthe result feels very generic."
186, "At the end of the movie they mentioned mexico as one of the devastated cities and my entire audience started LAUGHING it was great"
186, "I saw this film in a hair salon and until now I still wonder how the gay hairdressers were able to endure watching this movie given brad pitt's godawful hair situation"

187, "Sympathischer Hauptdarsteller und gute Umsetzung der Story. Jederzeit spannend und der Zuschauer versucht selbst die gesamte Zeit zu überlegenwas er dann in dieser Situation machen würde. Kritikpunkt istdass mich das Familienleben von Aron ein Scheiß interessiert. Hier hätte der Film sich noch ein paar Minuten sparen können."
187, "I would love this if it didn't get so cheesy...give me the blood and horrorDanny!"
187, "Grow some nuts and watch this fucking movie Kevin!"
187, "''Thanks!''"
187, "Thanks to this movie every time I don't pick up my phone my mom now thinks I'm trapped in a crevice and going through the same situation Aron Lee Ralston did (additionally to all of the other horror scenarios she thought of before)."
187, "4.5/10"
187, "If there was ever an antidepressant movie: it would be 127 Hours."
187, "There are a lot filmmaking efforts working here to inspire and somehow convince you cutting off your arm can be as important as """choose life""" (Trainspotting). Today I rate 127 Hours four stars. I know a rewatch will only bump it up to five. Really has a drug-like effect on you. Powerful Danny Boyle."
187, "Just couldn't get into this one. I realize this was based on a true storybut I couldn't muster any sympathy for the character as he was portrayed. Maybe I just don't like James Franco."

188, "The only Disney Princess I liked for the longest timemostly because this was so different compared to other Disney Princess films (i.e. I don’t like romance-centric stories)."
188, "Almost forgotten how many off-screen deaths occur in this movie. I guess it's pretty easy to lose sight of such strange details when <i>I'll Make A Man Out of You has constantly played in your head for the past 20 years...</p>"

190, "A fabulous film. A film which twists reality in just the right way. It delivers an excellent insight into sisterly relations and female sexualitywhile not being too overt about its themes. Some aspects of it are a little clumsy and hard to buy and while the ending does land it does so quite awkwardly (preventing this film from getting full marks). But damn as someone who barely watches films twice I am dying to see it again."
